I want to emphasize to you that all the versions of ReVanced that I share here have are safe to use. I guarantee that there are no viruses or malware that come with these apps.

Important Warning: Do not trust the ReVanced app circulating on Google or other unofficial sources. The original and secure version can only be found on GitHub. Make sure you download the app from a trusted source to avoid any unwanted risks.

 ## Notes
* Use [zygisk-detach](https://github.com/j-hc/zygisk-detach) to block Play Store from updating YouTube and YouTube-Music.
* Non-root versions of YouTube and YouTube-Music require [MicroG](https://github.com/ReVanced/GmsCore/releases) to work.
